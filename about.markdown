            Hi, my name is Maria I am a Full Stack Developer passionate 
            for Javascript and clean code. I have experience with Node.js, 
            React.js, mysql, postgresql and Jest.

            <p>
            I love building things. I really enjoy making applications and 
            websites, as I love doing sports and search new healthy recipes, 
            as easier as better.

            When I write code I like listen music like 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqLEI_ht_fY">this</a>,
            because let me to concentrate on what I'm doing and not in all 
            noises around.

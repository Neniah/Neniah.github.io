I got experience in other languages but about Python programming language I'm a newbie.
So I really like Codewars for practice with different exercises, I like that it is interactive,
and you can test your code immediately, and of your when you have finished your kata you can see other
people code and contrast.

For Decorators I found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJQ5XopgNog) video in youtube that I think it's very easy to undersand.

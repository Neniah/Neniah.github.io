Back to the roots sometimes is the best way to know where you are. So, I really
like matplotlib and I wanted to learn more about it. I think it is a beautiful
library for visualization. So I started with the first tutorial in the official
page. Sometimes when programmers want to learn something we look for a lot of posts,
tutorials from people who know more that us. And it's great, but I think sometimes
we lost our focus from official pages and this time I wanted to start with those tutorials.
Because in Matplotlib page you can find a lot of tutorials covering different levels
and topics. For example there is another tutorial on kaggle, 'Machine Learning Intermediate'
that I'd like to spend some time, will be soon.

It was probably the first of January of 2020 when I updated this blog the last time. I wannted to 
build my portfolio and Github pages sounds really good. Using Jekyll with Ruby in really interesting
because I don't remember the last time I've done a website using Ruby, and only with Rails. So here it is
my portfolio-website, I haven't so much settings on Jekyll I've just added some layout and a menu, and 
Bootstrap for styling.

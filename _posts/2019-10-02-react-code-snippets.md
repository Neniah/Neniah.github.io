It's been a while since I wrote the last post, a round a month. I still focus on python, and I went back to react.js again. 

So I'm used to use Atom editor, it's was my favourite, but lately I've been trying Visual Studio Code, I thought about trying Emacs also, I keep learning Emacs. While I learn enough Emacs...I decided use VS Code, and here it is a plugin for React.js that I find really useful, when you study some shortcuts...mmm, shortcuts everywhere.
